# BLDC-Book
Collection of resources for BLDC motor control. This book was orignally a collection of guides and manuals bound in a binder by Michael
Hibbard for UTA racing's electric car. I found this book very useful and informative and decided to add to the books and create a
reposity here to ensure longevity, the book is currently 3 3/4" binders worth of material collected from the internet.
