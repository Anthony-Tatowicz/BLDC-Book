# Motorcontrol-Book

Collection of resources for motor control.  

This book was originally a collection of guides and manuals bound in a binder by Michael Hibbard    
for UTA racing's electric car. I found this book very useful and informative and decided to add  
to the guide and create a repository here to ensure longevity, the book is currently 3 3/4" binders  
worth of material collected from the internet.
